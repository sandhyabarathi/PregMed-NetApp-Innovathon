            When you’re trying to conceive, any slight new symptom can get your heart pounding. Waiting to see if two pink lines are in store for you this month can be agony, so it’s hard not to read into every twinge, cramp and extra trip to the bathroom. But what are the first signs of pregnancy you should really be on the lookout for? Will you really start craving strange food combinations? And what about morning sickness? Does every woman experience the same pregnancy symptoms?

Here, with the help of medical experts, we break down the most common early signs of pregnancy, why they happen and what you can do to ease any ensuing discomfort. (Because let’s be honest, the symptoms of pregnancy don’t always feel the greatest.)

When Do Pregnancy Symptoms Start?
There’s no hard and fast rule for when early pregnancy symptoms kick in. Some women may begin noticing the first early signs of pregnancy a week or two after conception, while others will start to feel symptoms closer to four or five weeks after, when your period is conspicuously late, or even farther into pregnancy. According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, most women (59 percent) experienced an onset of pregnancy symptoms by their fifth or sixth week, while 71 percent reported symptoms by the end of week six and 89 percent by week eight.

            If you're not sure whether a particular activity is safe during pregnancy, check with your health care provider. Consider avoiding:

Any exercises that force you to lie flat on your back after your first trimester
Scuba diving, which could put your baby at risk of decompression sickness
Contact sports, such as ice hockey, soccer, basketball and volleyball
Activities that pose a high risk of falling — such as downhill skiing, in-line skating, gymnastics, and horseback riding
Activities that could cause you to hit water with great force, such as water skiing, surfing and diving
Other activities to avoid include:

Exercise at high altitude
Activities that could cause you to experience direct trauma to the abdomen, such as kickboxing
Hot yoga or hot Pilates
If you do exercise at a high altitude, make sure you know the signs and symptoms of altitude sickness, such as headache, fatigue and nausea. If you experience symptoms of altitude sickness, return to a lower altitude as soon as possible and seek medical care.

            When considering exercises for pregnancy, Cates says there aren’t a lot of activities that need to be removed from your current regimen.

“While the majority of exercises can be continued throughout each trimester, modifying and scaling back where needed can help increase the strength, stability, and physical adaptability as your body changes,” she says.

With that in mind, here are some general safety tips to consider when exercising during pregnancy, according to the ACOG.

            The highs and lows of pregnancy tests can be a killer. We all dream of that big fat positive (BFP), but sometimes you can tell the babymakin’ worked well before even taking a test (ugh, my achin’ boobs!). Bumpies on the 1st Trimester board shared how they knew :

“All of a sudden my dog smelled horrific even though he was clean and all smells/scents were much stronger." –Wildblue22

“I had been eating everything in sight! I normally had a pretty good appetite, but when my husband started commenting on my eating saying ‘how can you still be hungry?’ I knew there had to be a reason for it.” – shear22

“My boobs started hurting and I was so sleepy. I would desperately want a nap at all times of the day, which is weird for me.” – archyperu

“I started gagging while brushing my teeth, the week before I even tested. I just thought ‘well that’s new’ and kept about my business. I also started smelling everything and hating the way certain things smelled.” – ilovenaps

“My boobs hurt so bad and I noticed little stretch marks starting to form on the side of them. My husband also complained about me being irritated over everything and I would cry to sad songs on my iPod; I was kind of an emotional wreck.” – keni9

“I stopped liking chocolate!” – annya26

“My husband’s Old Spice aftershave started smelling like doughnuts. He smelled soooooo good! Then I noticed that I mysteriously did not have any PMS symptoms when I should have.” – redheadscu

“I like to enjoy a glass or two of wine every night. I kept feeling sick after having a glass, and it just didn’t taste good to me. Me not liking wine meant that something is going on.” – sascha3

“We were watching American Idol and I was exhausted, falling asleep all the time, I thought I had mono… I suddenly craved a bologna sandwich… which is nuts because I hate processed meat like that!” – jennjep24

            The digestive system is the most essential yet sensitive part of the human body. It consists of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and gallbladder.

It is essentially responsible for breaking down foods and liquids into chemical components such as protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Furthermore, it helps the body absorb these nutrients, utilising them as energy for proper functioning. Therefore, specific foods for the digestive system can help improve it whenever there is a process breakdown.

Our bodily functions depend heavily on food, which defines our internal health. A properly working digestive system plays a significant role in absorbing nutrients in the bloodstream, which are the body’s building blocks. Hence, maintaining an equilibrium of nutrients is essential for the proper functioning of the body.

            In this BBC program, “The Truth About Sleep,” which originally aired in 2017, Mosley investigates the health ramifications of insomnia, which is a problem he shares with many others in the world. In it, he reviews the hazards of sleep deprivation, and shares a variety of methods found to improve sleep quality and quantity.

About 70% of Britons feel they get less sleep than they need, and about a third report suffering from insomnia, Mosley says. His own problem has to do with staying asleep. While he has no problem falling asleep initially, he wakes up around 3 a.m. and has a hard time drifting off again. “I’m simply not getting enough sleep,” he says.

How Much Sleep Is Required for Health?
As noted by Mosley, the standard recommendation for adults is to get seven to eight hours of sleep per night. Teenagers need around nine hours, while younger school-kiage children may need upward of 11 hours.

While insomnia is one reason cited for lack of sleep, there are many other causes as well, including shift work and excessive partying. Our modern lifestyle, which glamorizes constant internet connectivity and round-the-clock activity, essentially conspires to keep us awake far longer than is healthy.

How can you tell if you’re actually sleep deprived or getting the “right” amount of sleep for you? Mosley demonstrates a test that can clue you in. It’s simple. Just go to bed in the middle of the afternoon and time how long it takes you to fall asleep. To conduct this sleep onset latency test, all you need is a watch, a metal spoon and a metal tray.

Place the metal tray next to your bed and lay down, holding the spoon in your hand so that when it falls, it will fall onto the tray. Relax. When you start falling asleep, the muscles in your hand will relax, causing the spoon to drop. The clanking will wake you up. Look at your watch. How long did it take you to drift off?

If it takes you more than 15 minutes, you’re getting enough sleep. If you fall asleep in less than 10 minutes, you’re moderately sleep deprived. Falling asleep in five minutes or less is indicative of severe sleep deprivation.

The High Cost of Sleep Deprivation
The price tag for sleep deprivation is steep. A bleary-eyed workforce costs the U.K. up to £40 billion (about $59 billion) a year in low productivity and absenteeism, Mosley notes. When asking random people on the street what keeps them up at night, the answers are manifold.

Many younger adults cite internet videos and social media. Working out in the evening, mental worries and a disruptive partner are other reasons people give for not getting enough shut-eye.

What Happens During Sleep?
Sleep is not just one long, solid state. Healthy sleep consists of several stages,1 each stage lasting five to 15 minutes, with a complete cycle (light, deep and rapid eye movement or REM sleep) taking between 90 and 120 minutes.

A full sleep cycle starts out in light sleep and progresses through to deep sleep, then reverses back from deep to light sleep before entering REM. You cycle through each of these stages four to six times during the night, and this cycling is tremendously important, from both a biological and psychological perspective.

            No matter your age or fitness level, these activities are some of the best exercises you can do and will help you get in shape and lower your risk for disease:

1. Swimming
You might call swimming the best workout. The buoyancy of the water supports your body and takes the strain off painful joints so you can move them more fluidly. "Swimming is good for individuals with arthritis because it's less weight-bearing," explains Dr. I-Min Lee, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

Research has found that swimming can also improve your mental state and put you in a better mood. Water aerobics is another option. These classes help you burn calories and tone up.

2. Tai chi
This Chinese martial art that combines movement and relaxation is good for both body and mind. In fact, it's been called "meditation in motion." Tai chi is made up of a series of graceful movements, one transitioning smoothly into the next. Because the classes are offered at various levels, tai chi is accessible — and valuable — for people of all ages and fitness levels. "It's particularly good for older people because balance is an important component of fitness, and balance is something we lose as we get older," Dr. Lee says.

Take a class to help you get started and learn the proper form. You can find tai chi programs at your local YMCA, health club, community center, or senior center.

3. Strength training
If you believe that strength training is a macho, brawny activity, think again. Lifting light weights won't bulk up your muscles, but it will keep them strong. "If you don't use muscles, they will lose their strength over time," Dr. Lee says.

Muscle also helps burn calories. "The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn, so it's easier to maintain your weight," says Dr. Lee. Similar to other exercise, strength training may also help preserve brain function in later years.
4. Walking
Walking is simple, yet powerful. It can help you stay trim, improve cholesterol levels, strengthen bones, keep blood pressure in check, lift your mood, and lower your risk for a number of diseases (diabetes and heart disease, for example). A number of studies have shown that walking and other physical activities can even improve memory and resist age-related memory loss.

All you need is a well-fitting and supportive pair of shoes. Start with walking for about 10 to15 minutes at a time. Over time, you can start to walk farther and faster, until you're walking for 30 to 60 minutes on most days of the week.

5. Kegel exercises
These exercises won't help you look better, but they do something just as important — strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder. Strong pelvic floor muscles can go a long way toward preventing incontinence. While many women are familiar with Kegels, these exercises can benefit men too.

To do a Kegel exercise correctly, squeeze the muscles you would use to prevent yourself from passing urine or gas. Hold the contraction for two or three seconds, then release. Make sure to completely relax your pelvic floor muscles after the contraction. Repeat 10 times. Try to do four to five sets a day.

            1. Berries
Be it blackberries, cranberries, strawberries or blueberries, berries of all kinds are super nutritious. Apart from being immensely rich in fibre, berries are quite low in fat, have a low calorie count, and are loaded with antioxidants. Its high mineral and vitamin density makes it an excellent type of fruit to consume. You can have them in their whole form to reap maximum benefits. 
2. Apple
Apple is one super-fruit that can prove to be quite beneficial in your weight loss journey. Rich in dietary fibre, flavonoids and beta-carotene, apple helps in increasing your level of satiety, further preventing you from overeating. The soluble fibre present in the fruit helps in drawing water from your digestive tract, which ultimately forms into a gel-like substance. This further slows the digestion and helps push the stool through the intestines smoothly, thereby aiding both digestion and weight loss.
3. Watermelon
Watermelon is loaded with health-benefiting properties. The high water content in it, about 94%, could possibly help you lose weight as well. It comes under the category of negative calorie fruit, since it tends to burn more calories during digestion than adding in. 
4. Orange
This nutrient-dense low-calorie fruit is the perfect pick to boost your immunity levels. It is abundantly rich in antioxidants and has zero fat content. Savour it as a whole to make the most of its fibre content.

5. Guava
This green, crunchy fruit aids better bowel movement and promotes digestion. The protein and good fibres in this fruit take a little long to digest, which helps in keeping you full for a longer duration of time. You can munch on it before your workout session as well

            You probably heard someone say to you, “Enjoy your sleep while you can,” at some point before your baby arrived into this world.

Now that your newborn is here, this age-old (maybe even cruel?) advice seems to be smacking you in the sleep-deprived face. 

Sleeplessness or sleep deprivation in parenthood may be a rite of passage, but it shouldn’t be. Sleep is important for your newborn but it’s also one of the best things you can do for yourself.

“Good, quality sleep is a cornerstone of good health and well-being,” said Russell Horton, DO, a physician with Banner Health in Phoenix, AZ. “It can lower stress, help you think more clearly and improve mood, maintain a healthy body weight and help boost your immune system.”

Although getting your recommended amount of sleep may seem more like a distant memory than a reality these days, quality sleep is still possible.

Dr. Horton shared 7 sleeping tips for new parents.

1. Try and sleep when the baby sleeps.\n

2. Get your head in the game … the sleep game.\n

3. Place the crib or bassinet near your bed.\n

4. Take shifts.\n

5. Ask for and accept help. \n

6. Take advantage of parental leave. \n

7. Take care of yourself.

            I’m 30 and having my first child. I’m over the moon and so excited to meet him or her. But I am so so unhappy with how I look and how much weight I have gained.
            I am only 15 weeks pregnant and have already gained 11 pounds ~ I didn’t have morning sickness and so started packing on the pounds from day one.

I’m worried as I estimate at this rate by the time I’m 30 weeks it will be 22 pounds if not more, and by 40 weeks I’ll probably be up to 33 or more as they the last few weeks is when you put on the most weight.
I’m having nightmares, crying about it during the day, I haven’t left the house in over a week and I have given up socializing because I feel so uncomfortable. I’m at a loss of what to do.

I will not starve my baby…
I exercise a minimum of 30 minutes 5/6 times a week (easy cycling)
I am also very conscious of what I eat, keeping it healthy and natural.
I really try to limit my unhealthy snacks!

I cannot see where I am going wrong or why my body is failing me.

Any advice you have for me would be so much appreciated. I’m feeling extremely lost and overwhelmed with this all.

            In this BBC program, “The Truth About Sleep,” which originally aired in 2017, Mosley investigates the health ramifications of insomnia, which is a problem he shares with many others in the world. In it, he reviews the hazards of sleep deprivation, and shares a variety of methods found to improve sleep quality and quantity.

About 70% of Britons feel they get less sleep than they need, and about a third report suffering from insomnia, Mosley says. His own problem has to do with staying asleep. While he has no problem falling asleep initially, he wakes up around 3 a.m. and has a hard time drifting off again. “I’m simply not getting enough sleep,” he says.

How Much Sleep Is Required for Health?
As noted by Mosley, the standard recommendation for adults is to get seven to eight hours of sleep per night.

            subtitle: "Just having to walk by treadmills, stationary bikes, and weight machines can be enough to make you head straight back home to the couch. Yet some of the best physical activities for your body don't require the gym or ask you to get fit enough to run a marathon. These workouts can do wonders for your health. They'll help keep your weight under control, improve your balance and range of motion, strengthen your bones, protect your joints, prevent bladder control problems, and even ward off memory loss.",

            No matter your age or fitness level, these activities are some of the best exercises you can do and will help you get in shape and lower your risk for disease:

1. Swimming
You might call swimming the best workout. The buoyancy of the water supports your body and takes the strain off painful joints so you can move them more fluidly. "Swimming is good for individuals with arthritis because it's less weight-bearing," explains Dr. I-Min Lee, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

Research has found that swimming can also improve your mental state and put you in a better mood. Water aerobics is another option. These classes help you burn calories and tone up.

2. Tai chi
This Chinese martial art that combines movement and relaxation is good for both body and mind. In fact, it's been called "meditation in motion." Tai chi is made up of a series of graceful movements, one transitioning smoothly into the next. Because the classes are offered at various levels, tai chi is accessible — and valuable — for people of all ages and fitness levels. "It's particularly good for older people because balance is an important component of fitness, and balance is something we lose as we get older," Dr. Lee says.

Take a class to help you get started and learn the proper form. You can find tai chi programs at your local YMCA, health club, community center, or senior center.

3. Strength training
If you believe that strength training is a macho, brawny activity, think again. Lifting light weights won't bulk up your muscles, but it will keep them strong. "If you don't use muscles, they will lose their strength over time," Dr. Lee says.

Muscle also helps burn calories. "The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn, so it's easier to maintain your weight," says Dr. Lee. Similar to other exercise, strength training may also help preserve brain function in later years.
4. Walking
Walking is simple, yet powerful. It can help you stay trim, improve cholesterol levels, strengthen bones, keep blood pressure in check, lift your mood, and lower your risk for a number of diseases (diabetes and heart disease, for example). A number of studies have shown that walking and other physical activities can even improve memory and resist age-related memory loss.

All you need is a well-fitting and supportive pair of shoes. Start with walking for about 10 to15 minutes at a time. Over time, you can start to walk farther and faster, until you're walking for 30 to 60 minutes on most days of the week.

5. Kegel exercises
These exercises won't help you look better, but they do something just as important — strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder. Strong pelvic floor muscles can go a long way toward preventing incontinence. While many women are familiar with Kegels, these exercises can benefit men too.

To do a Kegel exercise correctly, squeeze the muscles you would use to prevent yourself from passing urine or gas. Hold the contraction for two or three seconds, then release. Make sure to completely relax your pelvic floor muscles after the contraction. Repeat 10 times. Try to do four to five sets a day.

            subtitle: "Fruits are a powerhouse of various nutrients. Not only are they loaded with fibre content, but also contain various vitamins and minerals that can do wonders for our overall health, weight loss and digestion",

            1. Berries
Be it blackberries, cranberries, strawberries or blueberries, berries of all kinds are super nutritious. Apart from being immensely rich in fibre, berries are quite low in fat, have a low calorie count, and are loaded with antioxidants. Its high mineral and vitamin density makes it an excellent type of fruit to consume. You can have them in their whole form to reap maximum benefits. 
2. Apple
Apple is one super-fruit that can prove to be quite beneficial in your weight loss journey. Rich in dietary fibre, flavonoids and beta-carotene, apple helps in increasing your level of satiety, further preventing you from overeating. The soluble fibre present in the fruit helps in drawing water from your digestive tract, which ultimately forms into a gel-like substance. This further slows the digestion and helps push the stool through the intestines smoothly, thereby aiding both digestion and weight loss.
3. Watermelon
Watermelon is loaded with health-benefiting properties. The high water content in it, about 94%, could possibly help you lose weight as well. It comes under the category of negative calorie fruit, since it tends to burn more calories during digestion than adding in. 
4. Orange
This nutrient-dense low-calorie fruit is the perfect pick to boost your immunity levels. It is abundantly rich in antioxidants and has zero fat content. Savour it as a whole to make the most of its fibre content.

5. Guava
This green, crunchy fruit aids better bowel movement and promotes digestion. The protein and good fibres in this fruit take a little long to digest, which helps in keeping you full for a longer duration of time. You can munch on it before your workout session as well

            You probably heard someone say to you, “Enjoy your sleep while you can,” at some point before your baby arrived into this world.

Now that your newborn is here, this age-old (maybe even cruel?) advice seems to be smacking you in the sleep-deprived face. 

Sleeplessness or sleep deprivation in parenthood may be a rite of passage, but it shouldn’t be. Sleep is important for your newborn but it’s also one of the best things you can do for yourself.

“Good, quality sleep is a cornerstone of good health and well-being,” said Russell Horton, DO, a physician with Banner Health in Phoenix, AZ. “It can lower stress, help you think more clearly and improve mood, maintain a healthy body weight and help boost your immune system.”

Although getting your recommended amount of sleep may seem more like a distant memory than a reality these days, quality sleep is still possible.

Dr. Horton shared 7 sleeping tips for new parents.

1. Try and sleep when the baby sleeps.\n

2. Get your head in the game … the sleep game.\n

3. Place the crib or bassinet near your bed.\n

4. Take shifts.\n

5. Ask for and accept help. \n

6. Take advantage of parental leave. \n

7. Take care of yourself.

            I’m 30 and having my first child. I’m over the moon and so excited to meet him or her. But I am so so unhappy with how I look and how much weight I have gained.
            I am only 15 weeks pregnant and have already gained 11 pounds ~ I didn’t have morning sickness and so started packing on the pounds from day one.

I’m worried as I estimate at this rate by the time I’m 30 weeks it will be 22 pounds if not more, and by 40 weeks I’ll probably be up to 33 or more as they the last few weeks is when you put on the most weight.
I’m having nightmares, crying about it during the day, I haven’t left the house in over a week and I have given up socializing because I feel so uncomfortable. I’m at a loss of what to do.

I will not starve my baby…
I exercise a minimum of 30 minutes 5/6 times a week (easy cycling)
I am also very conscious of what I eat, keeping it healthy and natural.
I really try to limit my unhealthy snacks!

I cannot see where I am going wrong or why my body is failing me.

Any advice you have for me would be so much appreciated. I’m feeling extremely lost and overwhelmed with this all.
